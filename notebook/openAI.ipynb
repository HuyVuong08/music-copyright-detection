      "Transcribed Text: ♪♪ Downtown Detroit, ready to open the 2024 season with higher hopes and more expectations than we've seen with this franchise in decades. Matter of fact, around the country, people are saying this is the team to beat. The Detroit Lions are the best team in football. That Super Bowl's 154 days away. There's a whole lot that has to happen before you even get close to touching that game in New Orleans. They've got to handle their business right here, right now. Come on, 5A! It's time to f***ing eat! All that f***ing work is for this s*** right here! And for this s*** right here, we're not the same! This different around here! Y'all need some inspiration? I'm gonna show y'all. Y'all need some f***ing standard? I'm gonna show y'all. One, two, three! One, two, three! We're in! Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up! Beat him up! I was here doubling the projects, mad at myself for putting it to the side. Mama had to cater for the coop that we rode after school on the way to pot pies. And n****s want to play both sides. It's a red dot, don't get on the wrong red eye. It's a headshot, and you can't rule them guys. F*** around and bury two of them guys. I'm on the advance, I'm on the address. I thought that I told you I need the advance. Put down your IG and look through my lens. A million to grandma, who did I offend? The girl of your dreams to me is a fan. I netted 10 million and did a lil' dance. I'm f***ing the world, I answer my pens. My Uncle G told me that I had a chance. So then I popped out and did it again. And did it again, and did it again. I cannot respect him, where did he begin? Advice from the council, let nobody in. Been swearing through rumors, avoiding the trends. And dug in the holes, I'm ducking the loonie that come with the shows. I'm grateful to Mama, he opened the doors. And f*** when they told us to come and compose. I reached to the stars, on my tippy toes. It's greater success when most n****s fold. I'll tell you my past, that s*** don't get old. But how could you ask? Like I don't be writing my raps. Big critics got everyone tapped. You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleeps. Just tap in it, that's where I'm at. In the critical moment, we controlled that game. We had control of this game, all right? We gave it away. Which, was that them or us? That was us, man. All the stuff that's been here, that has kept us from winning. If we really wanna go where we wanna go, we gotta get all the rest of this f*** out of our stuff, man. All this dirt, everything that's in our f***ing jeans. This last bit of losing's gotta get out of here. The s*** that f***ing crushes us. That costs you a f***ing game. Costs you a season. Costs you the playoffs. Costs you a championship game. Costs you a Super Bowl. Like that's the s*** we gotta get out, man. When we have a game, and we own that game, we finish that game.\n"
