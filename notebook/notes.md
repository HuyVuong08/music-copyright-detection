# Shazham algorithm's papers:

Here are some key academic papers and resources on spectrogram-based fingerprinting algorithms, including those related to Shazam's approach:

### **1. Shazam's Original Paper**

-   **Title:** ["An Industrial Strength Audio Search Algorithm"](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf)
-   **Author:** Avery Li-Chun Wang (Co-founder of Shazam)
-   **Summary:** This paper describes Shazam's fingerprinting approach, detailing how it selects "constellation points" in a spectrogram and efficiently searches for matches in a database.

### **2. General Audio Fingerprinting Techniques**

-   **Title:** ["Robust Audio Fingerprinting for Song Identification"](https://ismir2002.ismir.net/proceedings/02-FP04-2.pdf)
-   **Authors:** Haitsma & Kalker (2002)
-   **Summary:** Explains a different but related approach using a hash-based fingerprinting scheme for audio identification.

-   **Title:** ["A Highly Robust Audio Fingerprinting System"](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/iis/en/doc/ame/Conference%20Papers/2006_A_Highly_Robust_Audio_Fingerprinting_System.pdf)

Would you like help summarizing one of these papers or implementing a basic version of the algorithm in Python?

# Shazham:

Shazam primarily uses a **spectrogram-based fingerprinting algorithm** to recognize music. The key steps in the algorithm are:

1. **Audio Processing & Spectrogram Creation**

    - The input audio is converted into a frequency-time representation using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.
    - This generates a **spectrogram**, which shows how the audio frequencies vary over time.

2. **Feature Extraction & Fingerprinting**

    - Shazam identifies key points in the spectrogram called **"constellation points"**—these are peaks in frequency that are resistant to noise and distortions.
    - A unique **hash (fingerprint)** is generated for each of these points based on frequency, time, and relative distances between peaks.

3. **Database Matching**

    - The extracted fingerprints are then **compared against Shazam’s vast database** of precomputed song fingerprints.
    - A **hash lookup table** allows for fast matching, even if the recording is noisy or contains background sound.

4. **Song Identification**
    - If a match is found with a sufficiently high confidence score, Shazam returns the song title, artist, and other metadata.

The key innovation of Shazam’s algorithm is its **robustness to noise and speed of lookup**, allowing it to recognize songs in just a few seconds, even from short or distorted audio clips.

# Recognizing songs from lyrics

There isn't a free OpenAI API specifically for recognizing songs from lyrics, but you can try the following alternatives:

1. **Musixmatch API** – Provides lyrics search and recognition services.

    - [https://developer.musixmatch.com/](https://developer.musixmatch.com/)

2. **Genius API** – Allows searching for lyrics and retrieving song metadata.

    - [https://docs.genius.com/](https://docs.genius.com/)

3. **Audd.io API** – Offers song recognition from lyrics and audio.

    - [https://audd.io/](https://audd.io/)

4. **Spotify API** – Can search for songs by lyrics in some cases.
    - [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)

If you need a free solution, you can manually query Musixmatch or Genius using their free tiers, but they may have request limits. Would you like help setting up an API call for one of these services?

AcoustID uses an **open-source audio fingerprinting algorithm** called **Chromaprint**, which differs from Shazam's method. Instead of detecting peak points in a spectrogram, **AcoustID/Chromaprint relies on chroma features** derived from the **frequency content of the audio**. Here’s how it works:

# AcoustID / Chromaprint Algorithm:

### **AcoustID / Chromaprint Algorithm Steps**

1. **Audio Preprocessing**

    - The input audio is converted to **mono** and downsampled to a lower sample rate (usually 11025 Hz) to reduce complexity.
    - Noise reduction and volume normalization are applied.

2. **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) & Chroma Feature Extraction**

    - A **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** is applied to analyze the frequency components of the audio over time.
    - Instead of using the full spectrogram, **Chromaprint extracts chroma features**, which capture the **tonal content (musical notes) rather than percussive elements**.
    - The output is a **chroma vector** that represents the distribution of energy in different musical pitch classes (C, C#, D, etc.).

3. **Fingerprint Creation**

    - The extracted chroma vectors are **compressed and hashed** into a fingerprint, capturing the **musical essence of the track**.
    - Unlike Shazam, AcoustID’s fingerprints focus on **melody and harmony rather than transient peaks**.

4. **Database Matching**

    - The fingerprint is queried against the **AcoustID database**, which maps fingerprints to song metadata.
    - Matches are found using a **nearest-neighbor search**, often leveraging techniques like **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** to speed up lookups.

5. **Identification & Metadata Retrieval**
    - If a match is found, the AcoustID API returns the associated **MusicBrainz ID**, song title, artist, and other metadata.

### **Key Differences Between AcoustID and Shazam**

| Feature | AcoustID / Chromaprint | Shazam |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Method** | Chroma-based fingerprinting | Spectrogram peak matching |
| **Focus** | Melody & harmony | Percussive & transient features |
| **Best For** | Identifying similar versions, covers, and remixes | Finding exact recordings |
| **Database** | Open-source (MusicBrainz) | Proprietary (Shazam) |

# LLM for song recognition:

Currently, there are **no free LLM models** that can directly recognize songs from an audio track like Shazam or AcoustID. However, you can achieve **music recognition** using a combination of open-source models and tools. Here’s how:

---

### **1. Open-Source Audio Fingerprinting Models**

Instead of LLMs, these tools use **signal processing and deep learning** to identify songs:

#### **A. AcoustID (Chromaprint) [Free & Open Source]**

-   Uses **chroma-based fingerprinting** to identify songs.
-   Works well for finding **different versions or covers** of a song.
-   **API:** [AcoustID API](https://acoustid.org/)
-   **Implementation:**

    ```python
    import acoustid
    import chromaprint

    API_KEY = "YOUR_ACOUSTID_API_KEY"
    audio_file = "song.mp3"

    fingerprint, duration = chromaprint.fingerprint_file(audio_file)
    matches = acoustid.lookup(API_KEY, fingerprint, duration)
    for match in matches:
        print(match)
    ```

---

#### **B. Music Recognition via Deep Learning**

If you want a deep learning approach, you can try **VGGish (Google’s model)** or **OpenL3**:

##### **VGGish (Google’s Audio Embedding Model)**

-   Converts audio into feature embeddings that can be used for classification.
-   Can be fine-tuned on a song dataset.

**Installation & Usage:**

```python
import torch
import torchaudio
from torchaudio.pipelines import VGGISH

model = VGGISH(pretrained=True)
waveform, sr = torchaudio.load("song.mp3")
features = model(waveform)
print(features.shape)  # Audio feature embeddings
```

##### **OpenL3 (Deep Learning Audio Features)**

-   Extracts high-level audio features from music tracks.
-   Useful for building custom music recognition models.

```python
import openl3
import soundfile as sf

audio, sr = sf.read("song.mp3")
embeddings, ts = openl3.get_audio_embedding(audio, sr)
print(embeddings.shape)  # Feature embeddings
```

---

### **2. Can LLMs Help in Music Recognition?**

While **LLMs (like GPT-4 or Llama 2) don't process audio**, they can:

-   **Analyze lyrics** from extracted text.
-   **Describe song characteristics** based on metadata.
-   **Assist in music recommendations** (e.g., "Suggest songs similar to X").

A **hybrid approach** could use a fingerprinting system like **AcoustID** + an **LLM** for metadata enrichment.

---

### **Do You Want a Custom Model?**

If you need **a full AI-powered song recognition system**, you could:

1. **Train a neural network** using **VGGish/OpenL3 embeddings** + a song database.
2. **Use a prebuilt API** like [Deezer’s API](https://developers.deezer.com/) or [Audd.io](https://audd.io/).
